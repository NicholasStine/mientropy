# To Do List


- **BUG** flashing input cursor shows on everything clicked
- **BUG** one of the tiles in the bottom row looks off
- basic game borders
- border textures
- counter component
- mine counter
- time counter
- reveal mines on game fail
- reveal bad flags on game fail
- bombs, height, and width dropdowns
- transparent mode (show numbers and mines under transparent tiles)
- flood reveal algorithm needs to be more inclusive. In the real game, when I click on a cluster of numbers (mine counts), it reveals them recursively even though there's no blank squares.


**05/09/2025**
DONE - **BUG** right clicking numbers or blank squares sets a flag

**05/06/2025**
DONE - flagged squares are unclickable
DONE - remove flag on right click already flagged tile
